TestAds is a program that tests the Google AdMob. It is configured with the Google test accounts. 

The Banner Ads can be turned on and off.
The Banner Ad ONLY responds to double clicks. No more accidental clicks.

I'm really not too sure how this whole Git thing works, so if you've got any suggestions, I'm open.

Thanks
